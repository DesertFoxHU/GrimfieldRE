**IMPORTANT!**
I will continue the project in a new private repository (there are a lot of reasons, but the main of them is becuase I am planning to upload this game to steam)
If you wish to be notified about updates you can find the game's itch.io page

This is a **turn-based multiplayer strategy game**.

**What features Grimfield will have that other strategy games usually don't have?**
- Complex industries and buildings
- More siege like, including walls and traps
- Territories and Diplomacies
